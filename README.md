# DailyWriterTools
Python tools for writing

open program
start writing
auto saving
word count output on write
end file
creates a text copy of days writing
creates a text copy of all combined writing
tells you what files are included
tells you how many words total

##Currently
- This will run with 'python autoWrite.py' in Terminal
- vim commands rule the day: i to insert, :w to write, and :q to quit, are the basics. type help or something like that. 
- to append to the days writing after the application has already run once, type 'python autoWrite.py' again, then 'shift + g' and then 'shift + a', instead of scrolling to the bottom this will take you there and press 'insert' for you.
- outputs number of words after quitting file
- does give overall word count for the month

##Does Not
- Does no make a file of everything written yet
- does not open text files of what you have written, for copying

write one file, rewrites two new files and gives you word counts
